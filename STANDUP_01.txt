General Update and Intro
========================

Project Leader: Pablo Bendiksen
Team Members: Surinder Kaur, Javidan Mammdadov, Jie Lin, Pablo Bendiksen
TA: Kiran
Created Github repo: https://github.com/pablobendiksen/trend-activated-trailing-stop-loss-bot

Draft of Requirements
=====================
MAIN: We will need to build a software that measures trend direction for the changing price of a market, then automatically buys/sells accordingly and smartly sets a trailing stop loss, all starting with a Moving Average Convergence/Divergence (MACD) model.

The software needs to support
* full automation of the trade process from signal generation, to automatic orders, to handling wallets, to risk management
* error handling for expected and unexpected errors
The software requirements:
* LUCIT System Suite of open source libraries (e.g, Unicorn Binance Websocket API and Unicorn Binance Trailing Stop Loss)
* User provided API Keys
* MACD and other indicators to be implemented
* Websocket connections for the streaming of order book and price data, that get closed and re-opened for every bot cyclemarkdown 
...

For technologies, we propose
* Python
* SQL

Current Questions / Problems / Something you need
=================================================
* Getting market data from VM and passing to project program on local machine
* Need to learn how to use the Unicorn Binance Trailing Stop Loss
* Need to see how data input converts to MACD output
* Need to experiment with our first indicator as a trigger to the trailing stop loss
...


List of Working Packages with responsible Student and Completion Dates
======================================================================

So far:
* Draft Document of Trading Basics
* Study Candlestick Chart
* Instantiate AWS VM Instance in ap-northeast-1a for low-latency program to server interaction
* Generate API Keys to Binance Futures Market for Data Reading

Todo:
* Connect to VM and run Program from Local Machine
* Sign up with TradingView and begin observing Candlestick Charts, possibly applying Trading Indicators [Jie Lin, Javidan Mammadov, Surinder Kaur] by 2/17
* Program the MACD to work with the Binance Futures Market [Pablo Bendiksen] by 2/17
* Work together to see how the MACD interacts with price charts visually, and then understand this in terms of the code  [Jie Lin, Javidan Mammadov, Surinder Kaur, Pablo Bendiksen] by 2/17
